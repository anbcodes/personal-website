    <h1>Discovering the Retry-After header</h1>

    <p>May 21st, 2022</p>

    <p>Recently I got a job on <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/users/anbcodes">fiverr</a> to scrape a website. The job was to extract some data from 32K different pages.</p>

		<p>I started by writing a simple Deno script that fetched a page and extracted the data. After creating that, I put it in a loop to request each page and save all the information to a file.</p>

		<p>This appeared to be working until my script failed to parse the file and threw a random error. I discovered that the server was returning <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429">429 Too Many Requests</a>. So I added a check to wait 20 seconds then try to continue requesting the pages.</p>

		<p>This worked, but it wasn't the most efficient because I had just guessed 20 seconds and did not know how long the server needed me to wait. I ended up increasing it to 60 seconds because that appeared to always work: the next request was always able to get through.</p>

		<p>I let this run for a while, but later stumbled apon the Retry-After header after doing some research about rate limiting. From <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After">MDN</a></p>

		<blockquote>The Retry-After response HTTP header indicates how long the user agent should wait before making a follow-up request.</blockquote>

		<p>It was perfect because I needed to know the amount of time to wait before retrying the request! So I added it into my script, and I think it ended up saving about 2-3 hours.</p>
